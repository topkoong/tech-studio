```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "name": "Webhook",
      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.webhook",
      "parameters": {
        "path": "slack-notification",
        "httpMethod": "POST"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "Slack",
      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.slack",
      "parameters": {
        "operation": "postMessage",
        "channel": "#general",
        "text": "New notification received!"
      }
    }
  ],
  "connections": {
    "Webhook": {
      "main": [
        [
          {
            "node": "Slack",
            "type": "main",
            "index": 0
          }
        ]
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Email to Google Sheets

Save incoming emails to a Google Sheet:

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "name": "Gmail Trigger",
      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.gmailTrigger",
      "parameters": {
        "pollTimes": {
          "item": [
            {
              "mode": "everyMinute"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "Google Sheets",
      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.googleSheets",
      "parameters": {
        "operation": "appendOrUpdate",
        "spreadsheetId": "your-spreadsheet-id",
        "sheetName": "Emails",
        "columns": {
          "mappingMode": "defineBelow",
          "value": {
            "Subject": "={{ $json.subject }}",
            "From": "={{ $json.from }}",
            "Date": "={{ $json.date }}",
            "Body": "={{ $json.body }}"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. GitHub to Discord

Send Discord notifications when new issues are created:

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "name": "GitHub Trigger",
      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.githubTrigger",
      "parameters": {
        "event": "issues",
        "action": "opened"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "Discord",
      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.discord",
      "parameters": {
        "operation": "postMessage",
        "channelId": "your-channel-id",
        "text": "New issue created: {{ $json.issue.title }}"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Advanced Workflow Patterns

### 1. Conditional Logic

Use IF nodes to create conditional workflows:

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "name": "Webhook",
      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.webhook"
    },
    {
      "name": "IF",
      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.if",
      "parameters": {
        "conditions": {
          "string": [
            {
              "value1": "={{ $json.type }}",
              "operation": "equal",
              "value2": "urgent"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "Slack Urgent",
      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.slack",
      "parameters": {
        "channel": "#urgent",
        "text": "🚨 URGENT: {{ $json.message }}"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "Slack Normal",
      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.slack",
      "parameters": {
        "channel": "#general",
        "text": "{{ $json.message }}"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Data Transformation

Use Function nodes to transform data:

```javascript
// Function node code
const items = $input.all();

return items.map((item) => {
  const data = item.json;

  return {
    json: {
      id: data.id,
      name: data.firstName + ' ' + data.lastName,
      email: data.email.toLowerCase(),
      createdAt: new Date(data.createdAt).toISOString(),
      status: data.active ? 'active' : 'inactive',
    },
  };
});
```

### 3. Error Handling

Use Error Trigger nodes to handle errors:

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "name": "HTTP Request",
      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest",
      "parameters": {
        "url": "https://api.example.com/data"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "Error Trigger",
      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.errorTrigger"
    },
    {
      "name": "Slack Error",
      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.slack",
      "parameters": {
        "channel": "#alerts",
        "text": "❌ API Error: {{ $json.error.message }}"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Scheduling Workflows

### Cron Expressions

Use cron expressions to schedule workflows:

```javascript
// Every day at 9 AM
'0 9 * * *';

// Every Monday at 10 AM
'0 10 * * 1';

// Every 5 minutes
'*/5 * * * *';

// Every hour
'0 * * * *';
```

### Schedule Node Example

```json
{
  "name": "Schedule Trigger",
  "type": "n8n-nodes-base.scheduleTrigger",
  "parameters": {
    "rule": {
      "interval": [
        {
          "field": "cronExpression",
          "expression": "0 9 * * *"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

# Pull the N8N Docker image
docker pull n8nio/n8n

# Run N8N container
docker run -it --rm --name n8n -p 5678:5678 n8nio/n8n
```

### 2. Docker Compose Setup

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  n8n:
    image: n8nio/n8n
    ports:
      - '5678:5678'
    environment:
      - N8N_BASIC_AUTH_ACTIVE=true
      - N8N_BASIC_AUTH_USER=admin
      - N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=password

```

### 3. npm Installation

```bash
# Install N8N globally
npm install n8n -g

# Start N8N
n8n start
```

## Basic Workflow Concepts

### 1. Nodes

Nodes are the building blocks of N8N workflows. Each node represents:

- **Triggers**: Start workflows (webhook, schedule, manual)
- **Actions**: Perform operations (HTTP request, database query)
- **Logic**: Control flow (IF, Switch, Merge)

### 2. Connections

Connections link nodes together and define the data flow between them.

### 3. Data Structure

N8N uses JSON objects to pass data between nodes. Each item contains:

```json
{
  "json": {
    "field1": "value1",
    "field2": "value2"
  },
  "binary": {},
  "pairedItem": 1
}
```

## Creating Your First Workflow

### 1. Simple Webhook Workflow

1. **Add Webhook Trigger**

   - Drag "Webhook" node to canvas
   - Configure HTTP method (POST)
   - Copy webhook URL

2. **Add HTTP Request Node**

   - Connect to webhook trigger
   - Configure URL and method
   - Set headers and body

3. **Add Response Node**
   - Connect to HTTP request
   - Set response data

### 2. Schedule-Based Workflow

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "parameters": {
        "rule": {
          "interval": [
            {
              "field": "cronExpression",
              "value": "0 9 * * 1-5"
            }
          ]
        }
      },
      "name": "Schedule Trigger",
      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.scheduleTrigger",
      "typeVersion": 1,
      "position": [240, 300]
    },
    {
      "parameters": {
        "url": "https://api.example.com/data",
        "options": {}
      },
      "name": "Fetch Data",
      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest",
      "typeVersion": 4.1,
      "position": [460, 300]
    }
  ],
  "connections": {
    "Schedule Trigger": {
      "main": [
        [
          {
            "node": "Fetch Data",
            "type": "main",
            "index": 0
          }
        ]
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Advanced Workflow Patterns

### 1. Conditional Logic

```json
{
  "parameters": {
    "conditions": {
      "string": [
        {
          "value1": "={{ $json.status }}",
          "operation": "equal",
          "value2": "active"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "name": "Check Status",
  "type": "n8n-nodes-base.if",
  "typeVersion": 2
}
```

### 2. Data Transformation

```javascript
// Code node example
const items = $input.all();

const transformedItems = items.map((item) => {
  const data = item.json;

  return {
    json: {
      id: data.id,
      name: data.name.toUpperCase(),
      email: data.email.toLowerCase(),
      processedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
    },
  };
});

return transformedItems;
```

### 3. Error Handling

```json
{
  "parameters": {
    "continueOnFail": true,
    "retryOnFail": true,
    "maxTries": 3,
    "waitBetweenTries": 1000
  },

      },
    },
  });
}
```

## Integration with External Systems

### 1. Database Integration

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  lineUserId: String,
  name: String,
  email: String,
  createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

async function handleUserMessage(event) {
  const user = await User.findOne({ lineUserId: event.source.userId });

  if (!user) {
    // Create new user
    const newUser = new User({
      lineUserId: event.source.userId,
      name: 'Unknown User',
    });
    await newUser.save();
  }

  // Process message based on user data
  return processMessage(event, user);
}
```

### 2. API Integration

```javascript
async function getWeatherData(city) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(
      `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${city}&appid=${process.env.WEATHER_API_KEY}`
    );
    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching weather data:', error);
    return null;
  }
}

async function handleWeatherRequest(event) {
  const city = event.message.text.replace('weather ', '');
  const weatherData = await getWeatherData(city);

  if (weatherData) {
    return client.replyMessage(event.replyToken, {
      type: 'text',
      text: `Weather in ${city}: ${weatherData.weather[0].description}, Temperature: ${weatherData.main.temp}°C`,
    });
  } else {
    return client.replyMessage(event.replyToken, {
      type: 'text',
      text: 'Sorry, I could not fetch weather data for that city.',
    });
  }
}
```

## Bot Analytics and Monitoring

### 1. Message Analytics

```javascript
const analyticsSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  userId: String,
  messageType: String,
  timestamp: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
  responseTime: Number,
});

const Analytics = mongoose.model('Analytics', analyticsSchema);

async function logMessageAnalytics(event, responseTime) {
  const analytics = new Analytics({
    userId: event.source.userId,
    messageType: event.message.type,
    responseTime: responseTime,
  });
  await analytics.save();
}
```

### 2. Performance Monitoring

```javascript
const startTime = Date.now();

// Process message
const result = await handleEvent(event);

const endTime = Date.now();
const responseTime = endTime - startTime;

// Log performance metrics
await logMessageAnalytics(event, responseTime);
```

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Webhook Verification

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifySignature(body, signature, secret) {
  const hash = crypto
    .createHmac('SHA256', secret)
    .update(body)
    .digest('base64');

  return hash === signature;
}

app.post('/webhook', (req, res) => {
  const signature = req.headers['x-line-signature'];

  if (!verifySignature(req.body, signature, config.channelSecret)) {
    return res.status(401).send('Unauthorized');
  }

  // Process webhook
});
```

### 2. Rate Limiting

```javascript
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
});

app.use('/webhook', limiter);
```

## Deployment and Scaling

### 1. Docker Configuration

```dockerfile
FROM node:16-alpine

WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install --production

COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["node", "index.js"]
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

```javascript
const config = {
  channelAccessToken: process.env.CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN,
  channelSecret: process.env.CHANNEL_SECRET,
  webhookUrl: process.env.WEBHOOK_URL,
  databaseUrl: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  port: process.env.PORT || 3000,
};
```

## Best Practices

### 1. **User Experience**

- Provide clear instructions and help messages
