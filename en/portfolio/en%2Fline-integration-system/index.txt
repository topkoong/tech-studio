### LINE Bot Setup

```javascript
const line = require('@line/bot-sdk');
const express = require('express');

const config = {
  channelAccessToken: process.env.CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN,
  channelSecret: process.env.CHANNEL_SECRET,
};

const client = new line.Client(config);
const app = express();

// Webhook endpoint
app.post('/webhook', line.middleware(config), (req, res) => {
  Promise.all(req.body.events.map(handleEvent))
    .then((result) => res.json(result))
    .catch((err) => {
      console.error('Webhook error:', err);
      res.status(500).end();
    });
});

async function handleEvent(event) {
  if (event.type !== 'message' || event.message.type !== 'text') {
    return Promise.resolve(null);
  }

  try {
    // Process message with NLP
    const response = await processMessage(
      event.message.text,
      event.source.userId
    );

    // Send response
    return client.replyMessage(event.replyToken, {
      type: 'text',
      text: response.text,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error handling event:', error);
    return client.replyMessage(event.replyToken, {
      type: 'text',
      text: 'Sorry, I encountered an error. Please try again.',
    });
  }
}
```

### Natural Language Processing

```javascript
const natural = require('natural');
const compromise = require('compromise');

class NLPService {
  constructor() {
    this.classifier = new natural.BayesClassifier();
    this.loadTrainingData();
  }

  async processMessage(text, userId) {
    // Intent classification
    const intent = this.classifier.classify(text);

    // Entity extraction
    const entities = this.extractEntities(text);

    // Sentiment analysis
    const sentiment = this.analyzeSentiment(text);

    // Generate response based on intent
    const response = await this.generateResponse(intent, entities, userId);

    // Log conversation for analytics
    await this.logConversation(userId, text, response, intent, sentiment);

    return response;
  }

  extractEntities(text) {
    const doc = compromise(text);
    return {
      people: doc.people().out('array'),
      places: doc.places().out('array'),
      organizations: doc.organizations().out('array'),
      dates: doc.dates().out('array'),
      money: doc.money().out('array'),
    };
  }

  analyzeSentiment(text) {
    const analyzer = new natural.SentimentAnalyzer();
    const stemmer = natural.PorterStemmer;
    const tokenizer = new natural.WordTokenizer();

    const tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(text);
    const stems = tokens.map((token) => stemmer.stem(token));

    return analyzer.getSentiment(stems);
  }

  async generateResponse(intent, entities, userId) {
    switch (intent) {
      case 'greeting':
        return await this.handleGreeting(userId);
      case 'product_inquiry':
        return await this.handleProductInquiry(entities);
      case 'support_request':
        return await this.handleSupportRequest(entities, userId);
      case 'order_status':
        return await this.handleOrderStatus(entities, userId);
      default:
        return await this.handleUnknownIntent();
    }
  }
}
```

### Rich Message Templates

```javascript
class MessageTemplates {
  static createCarouselMessage(products) {
    return {
      type: 'template',
      altText: 'Product catalog',
      template: {
        type: 'carousel',
        columns: products.map((product) => ({

          title: product.name,
          text: product.description,
          actions: [
            {
              type: 'postback',
              label: 'View Details',
              data: `action=view_product&id=${product.id}`,
            },
            {
              type: 'uri',
              label: 'Buy Now',
              uri: product.purchaseUrl,
            },
          ],
        })),
      },
    };
  }

  static createQuickReplyMessage(text, options) {
    return {
      type: 'text',

                uri: 'https://example.com',
              },
            },
          ],
        },
      },
    };
  }
}
```

### Database Integration

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

// User schema
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  lineUserId: { type: String, unique: true, required: true },
  name: String,
  email: String,
  preferences: {
    language: { type: String, default: 'en' },
    notifications: { type: Boolean, default: true },
  },
  conversationHistory: [
    {
      timestamp: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
      message: String,
      intent: String,
      sentiment: Number,
      response: String,
    },
  ],
  createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
  updatedAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
});

// Conversation analytics schema
const analyticsSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  date: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
  totalMessages: Number,
  uniqueUsers: Number,
  averageSentiment: Number,
  topIntents: [
    {
      intent: String,
      count: Number,
    },
  ],
  responseTime: {
    average: Number,
    p95: Number,
  },
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
const Analytics = mongoose.model('Analytics', analyticsSchema);

class DatabaseService {
  async getUser(lineUserId) {
    let user = await User.findOne({ lineUserId });

    if (!user) {
      user = new User({ lineUserId });
      await user.save();
    }

    return user;
  }

  async updateUserConversation(
    lineUserId,
    message,
    intent,
    sentiment,
    response
  ) {
    await User.updateOne(
      { lineUserId },
      {
        $push: {
          conversationHistory: {
            message,
            intent,
            sentiment,
            response,
          },
        },
        $set: { updatedAt: new Date() },
      }
    );
  }

  async generateDailyAnalytics() {
    const today = new Date();
    today.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);

    const users = await User.find({
      'conversationHistory.timestamp': { $gte: today },
    });

    const analytics = {
      date: today,
      totalMessages: users.reduce(
        (sum, user) => sum + user.conversationHistory.length,
        0
      ),
      uniqueUsers: users.length,
      averageSentiment: this.calculateAverageSentiment(users),
      topIntents: this.getTopIntents(users),
      responseTime: await this.calculateResponseTime(),
    };

    await Analytics.create(analytics);
    return analytics;
  }
}
```

### Workflow Automation

```javascript
class WorkflowService {
  async handleSupportRequest(entities, userId) {
    const user = await databaseService.getUser(userId);

    // Check if user has existing tickets
    const existingTicket = await this.findExistingTicket(userId);
    if (existingTicket) {
      return this.getTicketStatusMessage(existingTicket);
    }

    // Create new ticket
    const ticket = await this.createSupportTicket({
      userId,
      description: entities.description || 'General support request',
      priority: this.determinePriority(entities),
      category: this.categorizeRequest(entities),
    });

    // Notify support team
    await this.notifySupportTeam(ticket);

    // Send confirmation to user
    return MessageTemplates.createFlexMessage(
      'Support Ticket Created',
      `Your support ticket #${ticket.id} has been created. Our team will respond within 24 hours.`
    );
  }

  async createSupportTicket(ticketData) {
    const ticket = {
      id: this.generateTicketId(),
      userId: ticketData.userId,
      description: ticketData.description,
      priority: ticketData.priority,
      category: ticketData.category,
      status: 'open',
      createdAt: new Date(),
      assignedTo: null,
    };

    // Save to database
    await Ticket.create(ticket);

    // Integrate with CRM system
    await this.syncWithCRM(ticket);

    return ticket;
  }

  determinePriority(entities) {
    const urgentKeywords = ['urgent', 'critical', 'emergency', 'asap'];
    const text = entities.text?.toLowerCase() || '';

    if (urgentKeywords.some((keyword) => text.includes(keyword))) {
      return 'high';
    }

    return 'medium';
  }
}
```

### Performance Optimization

```javascript
const Redis = require('redis');
const redisClient = Redis.createClient(process.env.REDIS_URL);

class CacheService {
  async getCachedResponse(intent, entities) {
    const key = `response:${intent}:${JSON.stringify(entities)}`;
    const cached = await redisClient.get(key);
    return cached ? JSON.parse(cached) : null;
  }

  async cacheResponse(intent, entities, response) {
    const key = `response:${intent}:${JSON.stringify(entities)}`;
    await redisClient.setex(key, 3600, JSON.stringify(response)); // Cache for 1 hour
  }

  async getUserContext(userId) {
    const key = `context:${userId}`;
    const context = await redisClient.get(key);
    return context ? JSON.parse(context) : {};
  }

  async setUserContext(userId, context) {
    const key = `context:${userId}`;
    await redisClient.setex(key, 1800, JSON.stringify(context)); // Cache for 30 minutes
  }
}
```

## Analytics and Reporting

### Conversation Analytics

```javascript
class AnalyticsService {
  async generateReport(startDate, endDate) {
    const conversations = await Conversation.find({
      timestamp: { $gte: startDate, $lte: endDate },
    });

    const report = {
      totalConversations: conversations.length,
      uniqueUsers: new Set(conversations.map((c) => c.userId)).size,
      averageMessagesPerConversation:
        this.calculateAverageMessages(conversations),
      topIntents: this.getTopIntents(conversations),
      sentimentDistribution: this.analyzeSentimentDistribution(conversations),
      responseTimeMetrics: this.calculateResponseTimeMetrics(conversations),
      userSatisfactionScore: await this.calculateSatisfactionScore(
        conversations
      ),
    };

    return report;
  }

  async calculateSatisfactionScore(conversations) {
    const feedbackMessages = conversations.filter(
      (c) => c.intent === 'feedback' || c.message.includes('satisfied')
    );

    if (feedbackMessages.length === 0) return null;

    const positiveFeedback = feedbackMessages.filter(
      (c) => c.sentiment > 0.2
    ).length;

    return (positiveFeedback / feedbackMessages.length) * 100;
  }
}
```

## Security and Compliance

### Data Protection

```javascript
class SecurityService {
  encryptSensitiveData(data) {
    const crypto = require('crypto');
    const algorithm = 'aes-256-gcm';
    const key = Buffer.from(process.env.ENCRYPTION_KEY, 'hex');
    const iv = crypto.randomBytes(16);

    const cipher = crypto.createCipher(algorithm, key);
    cipher.setAAD(Buffer.from('line-bot-data'));

    let encrypted = cipher.update(JSON.stringify(data), 'utf8', 'hex');
    encrypted += cipher.final('hex');

    const authTag = cipher.getAuthTag();

    return {
      encrypted,
      iv: iv.toString('hex'),
      authTag: authTag.toString('hex'),
    };
  }

  validateWebhookSignature(body, signature) {
    const crypto = require('crypto');
    const hash = crypto
      .createHmac('SHA256', process.env.CHANNEL_SECRET)
      .update(body)
      .digest('base64');

    return hash === signature;
  }
