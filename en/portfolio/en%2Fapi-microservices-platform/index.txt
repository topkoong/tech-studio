# API & Microservices Platform

A comprehensive microservices platform designed to handle enterprise-scale applications with high availability, performance, and scalability. Built using Spring Boot, Kafka, and modern containerization technologies.

## Project Overview

This microservices platform was developed for an enterprise client requiring a scalable, maintainable architecture to support their growing business needs. The platform handles millions of requests daily with 99.99% uptime and sub-second response times.

## Architecture Overview

### Microservices Design

- **User Service**: Handles authentication, authorization, and user management
- **Order Service**: Manages order processing and fulfillment
- **Payment Service**: Processes payments and financial transactions
- **Notification Service**: Sends emails, SMS, and push notifications
- **Inventory Service**: Manages product inventory and availability

### API Gateway

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/v1")
public class ApiGatewayController {

    @Autowired
    private ServiceDiscoveryClient discoveryClient;

    @Autowired
    private CircuitBreakerService circuitBreaker;

    @PostMapping("/orders")
    public ResponseEntity<OrderResponse> createOrder(@RequestBody OrderRequest request) {
        try {
            // Route to Order Service
            String orderServiceUrl = discoveryClient.getServiceUrl("order-service");

            return circuitBreaker.execute(() ->
                restTemplate.postForEntity(orderServiceUrl + "/orders", request, OrderResponse.class)
            );
        } catch (Exception e) {
            return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE).build();
        }
    }
}
```

## Service Implementation

### User Service

```java
@Service
@Transactional
public class UserService {

    @Autowired
    private UserRepository userRepository;

    @Autowired
    private KafkaTemplate<String, Object> kafkaTemplate;

    public User createUser(CreateUserRequest request) {
        // Validate input
        validateUserRequest(request);

        // Create user entity
        User user = User.builder()
            .email(request.getEmail())
            .name(request.getName())
            .role(request.getRole())
            .status(UserStatus.ACTIVE)
            .createdAt(LocalDateTime.now())
            .build();

        // Save to database
        User savedUser = userRepository.save(user);

        // Publish event
        UserCreatedEvent event = UserCreatedEvent.builder()
            .userId(savedUser.getId())
            .email(savedUser.getEmail())
            .name(savedUser.getName())
            .timestamp(LocalDateTime.now())
            .build();

        kafkaTemplate.send("user-created", event);

        return savedUser;
    }

    private void validateUserRequest(CreateUserRequest request) {
        if (userRepository.existsByEmail(request.getEmail())) {
            throw new UserAlreadyExistsException("User with email already exists");
        }
    }
}
```

### Order Service with Event Sourcing

```java
@Service
public class OrderService {

    @Autowired
    private OrderRepository orderRepository;

    @Autowired
    private EventStore eventStore;

    @Autowired
    private KafkaTemplate<String, Object> kafkaTemplate;

    public Order createOrder(CreateOrderRequest request) {
        // Create order aggregate
        OrderAggregate order = OrderAggregate.builder()
            .userId(request.getUserId())
            .items(request.getItems())
            .status(OrderStatus.PENDING)
            .build();

        // Apply business logic
        order.validateOrder();
        order.calculateTotal();

        // Save events
        List<DomainEvent> events = order.getUncommittedEvents();
        eventStore.saveEvents(order.getId(), events);

        // Publish events
        events.forEach(event -> kafkaTemplate.send("order-events", event));

        return order.toOrder();
    }
}
```

## Event-Driven Architecture

### Kafka Configuration

```yaml
# application.yml
spring:
  kafka:
    bootstrap-servers: kafka-cluster:9092
    consumer:
      group-id: ${spring.application.name}
      auto-offset-reset: earliest
      key-deserializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer
      value-deserializer: org.springframework.kafka.support.serializer.JsonDeserializer
    producer:
      key-serializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer
      value-serializer: org.springframework.kafka.support.serializer.JsonSerializer
```

### Event Handlers

```java
@Component
public class OrderEventHandler {

    @Autowired
    private InventoryService inventoryService;

    @Autowired
    private PaymentService paymentService;

    @KafkaListener(topics = "order-created")
    public void handleOrderCreated(OrderCreatedEvent event) {
        try {
            // Reserve inventory
            inventoryService.reserveItems(event.getOrderId(), event.getItems());

            // Process payment
            PaymentResult result = paymentService.processPayment(
                event.getOrderId(),
                event.getTotalAmount()
            );

            if (result.isSuccess()) {
                // Confirm order
                publishOrderConfirmed(event.getOrderId());
            } else {
                // Cancel order
                publishOrderCancelled(event.getOrderId(), result.getReason());
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // Handle error
            publishOrderFailed(event.getOrderId(), e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

## Caching Strategy

### Redis Configuration

```java
@Configuration
@EnableCaching
public class CacheConfig {

    @Bean
    public RedisTemplate<String, Object> redisTemplate(RedisConnectionFactory connectionFactory) {
        RedisTemplate<String, Object> template = new RedisTemplate<>();
        template.setConnectionFactory(connectionFactory);
        template.setDefaultSerializer(new GenericJackson2JsonRedisSerializer());
        return template;
    }

    @Bean
    public CacheManager cacheManager(RedisConnectionFactory connectionFactory) {
        RedisCacheConfiguration config = RedisCacheConfiguration.defaultCacheConfig()
            .entryTtl(Duration.ofMinutes(30))
            .serializeKeysWith(RedisSerializationContext.SerializationPair
                .fromSerializer(new StringRedisSerializer()))
            .serializeValuesWith(RedisSerializationContext.SerializationPair
                .fromSerializer(new GenericJackson2JsonRedisSerializer()));

        return RedisCacheManager.builder(connectionFactory)
            .cacheDefaults(config)
            .build();
    }
}
```

### Service-Level Caching

```java
@Service
public class ProductService {

    @Autowired
    private ProductRepository productRepository;

    @Cacheable(value = "products", key = "#productId")
    public Product getProduct(String productId) {
        return productRepository.findById(productId)
            .orElseThrow(() -> new ProductNotFoundException("Product not found"));
    }

    @CacheEvict(value = "products", key = "#product.id")
    public Product updateProduct(Product product) {
        return productRepository.save(product);
    }

    @Cacheable(value = "products", key = "'category:' + #category")
    public List<Product> getProductsByCategory(String category) {
        return productRepository.findByCategory(category);
    }
}
```

## Monitoring and Observability

### Health Checks

```java
@Component
public class CustomHealthIndicator implements HealthIndicator {

    @Autowired
    private DatabaseHealthChecker databaseChecker;

    @Autowired
    private KafkaHealthChecker kafkaChecker;

    @Override
    public Health health() {
        Health.Builder builder = new Health.Builder();

        try {
            // Check database connectivity
            boolean dbHealthy = databaseChecker.isHealthy();
            builder.withDetail("database", dbHealthy ? "UP" : "DOWN");

            // Check Kafka connectivity
            boolean kafkaHealthy = kafkaChecker.isHealthy();
            builder.withDetail("kafka", kafkaHealthy ? "UP" : "DOWN");

            if (dbHealthy && kafkaHealthy) {
                return builder.up().build();
            } else {
                return builder.down().build();
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            return builder.down().withException(e).build();
        }
    }
}
```

### Metrics Collection

```java
@Component
public class OrderMetrics {

    private final MeterRegistry meterRegistry;
    private final Counter orderCreatedCounter;
    private final Timer orderProcessingTimer;

    public OrderMetrics(MeterRegistry meterRegistry) {
        this.meterRegistry = meterRegistry;
        this.orderCreatedCounter = Counter.builder("orders.created")
            .description("Number of orders created")
            .register(meterRegistry);
        this.orderProcessingTimer = Timer.builder("orders.processing.time")
            .description("Order processing time")
            .register(meterRegistry);
    }

    public void incrementOrderCreated() {
        orderCreatedCounter.increment();
    }

    public void recordOrderProcessingTime(Duration duration) {
        orderProcessingTimer.record(duration);
    }
}
```

## Containerization and Deployment

### Docker Configuration

```dockerfile
FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY target/user-service.jar app.jar

EXPOSE 8080

HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:8080/actuator/health || exit 1

ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
```

### Kubernetes Deployment

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: user-service
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: user-service
  template:

              cpu: '250m'
            limits:
              memory: '1Gi'
              cpu: '500m'
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /actuator/health
              port: 8080
            initialDelaySeconds: 30
            periodSeconds: 10
          readinessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /actuator/health
              port: 8080
            initialDelaySeconds: 5
            periodSeconds: 5
```

## Performance Optimization

### Database Optimization

```sql
-- Optimized indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_id ON orders(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_status ON orders(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_created_at ON orders(created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_order_items_order_id ON order_items(order_id);

-- Partitioning for large tables
CREATE TABLE orders_2024 PARTITION OF orders
FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2025-01-01');
```

### Connection Pooling

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    hikari:
      maximum-pool-size: 20
      minimum-idle: 5
      connection-timeout: 30000
      idle-timeout: 600000
      max-lifetime: 1800000
```

## Security Implementation

### Authentication & Authorization

```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig {

    @Bean
    public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .csrf().disable()
            .authorizeHttpRequests(authz -> authz
                .requestMatchers("/api/v1/public/**").permitAll()
                .requestMatchers("/api/v1/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
                .anyRequest().authenticated()
            )
            .oauth2ResourceServer(oauth2 -> oauth2
                .jwt(jwt -> jwt
                    .jwtAuthenticationConverter(jwtAuthenticationConverter())
                )
            );

        return http.build();
    }
}
```

### API Rate Limiting

```java
@Component
public class RateLimitingFilter implements Filter {

    private final RedisTemplate<String, String> redisTemplate;

    @Override
    public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain)
            throws IOException, ServletException {

        HttpServletRequest httpRequest = (HttpServletRequest) request;
        String clientId = getClientId(httpRequest);

        if (isRateLimited(clientId)) {
            HttpServletResponse httpResponse = (HttpServletResponse) response;
            httpResponse.setStatus(HttpStatus.TOO_MANY_REQUESTS.value());
            return;
        }

        chain.doFilter(request, response);
    }

    private boolean isRateLimited(String clientId) {
        String key = "rate_limit:" + clientId;
        String count = redisTemplate.opsForValue().get(key);

        if (count == null) {
            redisTemplate.opsForValue().set(key, "1", Duration.ofMinutes(1));
            return false;
        }

        int currentCount = Integer.parseInt(count);
        if (currentCount >= 100) { // 100 requests per minute
            return true;
        }

        redisTemplate.opsForValue().increment(key);
        return false;
    }
